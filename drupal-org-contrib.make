;
;  MENU MODULES
;___________________________________________________

; PATH AUTO
; The Pathauto module automatically generates URL/path aliases for various kinds of content (nodes, taxonomy terms, users) without requiring the user to

;  CONTENT MODULES
;___________________________________________________

; results, filters, etc. Also, with the Apache Solr integration, a high-performance search engine is available for this module. Developers, on the other hand,
; will be impressed by the large flexibility and numerous ways of extension the module provides. Hence, the growing number of additional contrib modules (linked
; below), providing additional functionality or helping users customize some aspects of the search process.
projects[search_api][version] = "1.4"

; SEARCH API SAVED SEARCHES
; This module offers users the ability to save searches executed with the Search API module and be notified of new results. Notifications are done via mails

; search.
projects[search_api_saved_searches][version] = "1.0"

; SEARCH API AUTOCOMPLETE

projects[search_api_autocomplete][version] = "1.0-beta2"

; SEARCH API SOLR
; This module provides a Solr backend for the Search API module. The backend uses, like the popular Apache Solr Search Integration module, Apache Solr servers

; ADMIN TOOLS
; Admin Tools is an addon module for the Admin module, which provides a sidebar navigation for selected roles.
projects[admin_tools] = "1.1"

; JSON-RPC, SOAP, AMF, etc. This allows a Drupal site to provide web services via multiple interfaces while using the same callback code.
projects[services][version] = "3.3"

; CODER
; The Coder project includes two developer modules that assist with code review (Coder Review maintained by douggreen and stella) and code manipulation (Coder

; rid in their export code, such as Views, Ctools, Rules, etc. References to this role id will not break on other sites.
; projects[role_export][version] = "1.0"

; WEBFORM
; Webform is the module for making surveys in Drupal. After a submission, users may be sent an e-mail "receipt" as well as sending a notification to
